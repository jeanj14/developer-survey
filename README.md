# Developer Survey 

## Welcome all Developers

I made a survey with trivia questions , based on previous surveys done by StackOverflow. Anyone of all various experience levels are welcome to try it. Please test it out and let me know how I can improve :)

This project is meant to help mature my front-end and back-end skills. The website is rendered via a local Express server. Input recieved from the survey will be parsed and saved as a text file. I have plans to save the input on a database but I will definitely integrate it sometime in the future.
